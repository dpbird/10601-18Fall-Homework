I am contacting you because you have posted questions and solutions to course materials from 10601 and made it public for everyone to find. 
This is in violation of CMU's academic integrity policy. Even after leaving each course of graduating from the university, you are not allowed 
to share questions/solutions. Can you please take these down or make them private asap?
